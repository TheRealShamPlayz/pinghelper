Hello! Thank you for downloading Ping Helper! (If I am being honest, I could not find a good name for this program)
The program can either show you how to improve your connection (essentially a walkthrough) or automagically apply some settings to help your ping!
(Just a quick heads up, with both "modes" you are still going to have to do some stuff yourself, like installing some applications, but this program will help you through those things)
Before you run this program in either express or walkthrough "mode",
PLEASE
PLEASE
PLEASE
MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR REGISTRY!!!!!!!!!
Both "Installation Modes" will show you how to do this, so do not worry if you don't know how to.
The reason you should do this is because something can go wrong with regristry editing. It is like trying to delete cortana (yes im using that as an example).
If you don't take the right precations, you can be screwed over. If you do, you have a backup to fix this mess!
So just to be safe, PLEASE DO IT!!!!
Anyways, that is it!
Enjoy your low Ping!
